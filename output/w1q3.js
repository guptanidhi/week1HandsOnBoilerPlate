/*Q3:  Write a JavaScript program to display the current day 
	and time in the following format mm/dd/yyyy?
*/

// Get current date by new Date() in 1 variable like today

// From today variable get only DATE like 4,20
  
// From today variable get Month and add 1 because it starts from 0 index
  
//  From today variable get year in YYYY format 

// Logic for appending 0 if date and month is less than 10 to show 6/6/2017 to 06/06/2017

  
// Print date in this format mm/dd/yyyy

module.exports = new Date();
